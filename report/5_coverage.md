# 5 Test Coverage Analysis

Testing is implemented using the Truffle Framework.

The [Solidity-Coverage](https://github.com/sc-forks/solidity-coverage) tool was used to measure the portion of the code base exercised by the test suite, and identify areas with little or no coverage.

It's important to note that "100% test coverage" is not a silver bullet. Our review also included a inspection of the test suite, to ensure that testing included important edge cases.

The state of test coverage prior to and after our audit can be viewed in html rendered from the Github repo, or by opening the `index.html` file from the report directory in a browser.
